**Overall**
---

**What is good about this work?**

Very well presented and thorough documentation. All round excellent piece of work - very well written, organised and the site is very effective and fits the theme.

**What needs to be done to make it better?**

Your planning document could have been slightly more thorough in places, and you could have used one or two more
functions with parameters to cut down on javascript code a little.
