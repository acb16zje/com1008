| --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Stage 1: Planning and design document** | | |
| <ul><li><strong>Site map. Accessibility; Design mockup diagrams and discussion; Menu:</strong> A low mark suggests that you need to think more carefully about what is required in creating a structured website and how to use RWD; A mark in the middle of the range suggests that you have some understanding of how to structure a website and/or how to use RWD. A high mark suggests you are well on your way to understanding how to use RWD to create structured Websites</li></ul> | 8 | 10 |
| **Stage 2: Website** | | |
| <ul><li><strong>Look and Feel and RWD:</strong>  Consistent design of pages; Good contrast between text and background. Header/banner, a main content section and a footer on every web page. Each page should identify the web site in some way, e.g. using name or a logo. Footer should give authorship and date info. A navigation area should be included in the web site. Is there a clear separation between the main areas of the web site? Is the interaction obvious and not clunky? Are all the requested pages/info included? The contact page must send e-mail to the student’s own address, i.e. not my address!! Good use of RWD to give a professional look and feel. Menu works well for desktop and small screen versions. Good use of images on the web site.</li> | <ul><li>15</li></ul> | <ul><li>15</li></ul> |
| <ul><li><strong>HTML:</strong>  Head includes a title and a meta element for the author’s name. Use of html5 header, nav, main, (section or article) and footer for areas of a page. Is there a matching end tag in all elements? Alt in imgs? Appearance should be handled by the linked stylesheets; no inline styles. Comments for main structural elements. Clear layout. Structured to cope with RWD aspects.</li></ul> | <ul><li>15</li></ul> | <ul><li>15</li></ul> |
| <ul><li><strong>CSS:</strong> Stylesheet rules for: page areas, and economic use of properties. Any font-family should include a generic family name as its last value. RWD use of % for widths; Is the use of @media incorporated well? Is there a clear ordering for the rules, or is it a haphazard listing? Comments for rules.</li></ul> | <ul><li>15</li></ul> | <ul><li>15</li></ul> |
| <ul><li><strong>JavaScript and Canvas:</strong> Does the puzzle game work well? Are the animation effects good? Is the JavaScript well structured and well laid out?</li></ul> | <ul><li>14</li></ul> | <ul><li>15</li></ul> |
| **Stage 3: Development and testing document** | | |
| <ul><li>Description of the development process? Is there a statement of tools used, with reasoning, e.g. debugging? Were templates used? Optimisation and fallback strategies? Description of the general testing process? Were multiple browsers tested – is there evidence of this? RWD testing? Have the html and css validators been used – is there evidence of this? A low mark suggests that you need to think more carefully about what is required in development and testing. A mark in the middle of the range suggests that you have some understanding of the process and some consideration of attention to detail. A high mark suggests you are well on your way to understanding how to document and test the web sites you develop.</li></ul> | 10 | 10 |

**Overall**
---

**What is good about this work?**
- Very well presented and thorough documentation.
- All round excellent piece of work - very well written, organised and the site is very effective and fits the theme.

**What needs to be done to make it better?**
- Your planning document could have been slightly more thorough in places, and you could have used
  one or two more functions with parameters to cut down on javascript code a little.
